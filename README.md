**Product Development Lead & Tech Lead - Imaginary Hub**  
Led the end-to-end development of Imaginary Hub, an innovative e-learning platform, where I was responsible for both product strategy and the technical execution of core features. My role combined overseeing product development with hands-on involvement in technical solutions, ensuring seamless integration of features and a robust user experience. Key contributions included:

- **Product Strategy & Roadmap**: Defined the product vision and development roadmap, aligning platform features with both user needs and business goals.
- **Cross-Functional Team Leadership**: Led teams across frontend, backend, and design, coordinating efforts to ensure timely and successful delivery of the platform.
- **Core Feature Development**: Played a key role in developing critical platform features such as user authentication, course management, Razorpay payment integration, feedback systems, and dynamic content rendering.
- **Tech Solution Architecting**: Worked hands-on in the development and integration of server-side technologies, creating a reliable backend and seamless frontend experience.
- **Tech Stack Implementation**: Developed the platform using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB** for backend logic and data management. Ensured secure payment integration with **Razorpay** and external video hosting via API integration.
- **Agile Methodology**: Embraced agile practices to ensure iterative development and continuous improvement, with regular sprints, stakeholder feedback, and rapid prototyping.
- **Collaborative Development**: Worked closely with both backend and frontend teams to integrate complex systems like secure authentication using **Passport.js**, dynamic content rendering via **EJS templates**, and automated feedback collection forms.

**Tech Stack (Tech Development)**:  
- **Node.js, Express.js** – For developing backend server-side logic.  
- **MongoDB, Mongoose** – Database management and schema definitions.  
- **Razorpay** – Integrated for secure payment processing.  
- **Passport.js** – For user authentication and authorization.  
- **EJS** – For dynamic content rendering.  
- **External APIs** – Integrated video hosting services for course content display.

As both the Product and Tech Lead, I ensured that the platform was not only user-focused but also built on strong technical foundations, delivering an efficient and scalable solution for the e-learning industry.
